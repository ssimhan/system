# /clear — Reset Claude’s Context Safely

Use this command to clear Claude's memory and reset your working session. This is especially helpful after:

* Long conversations
* Reaching 100k+ tokens
* Multiple compacting warnings

## 🧩 What it Does

* Clears current context
* Does *not* delete any files or commit history
* Signals Claude to reread grounding documents on next command (e.g. product vision, implementation plan)

## 🧠 Why Clear?

Claude will slow down or lose flow if too much is loaded in memory. Resetting:

* Improves response time
* Prevents hallucinations or context loss
* Ensures next commands start fresh

## ✅ Workflow Tip

After clearing, immediately re-ground Claude:

```md
Here’s what we’re building:
/docs/product-vision.md

Here’s our current plan:
/claude/implementation-plan.md
```

Then reissue your next command (e.g., `/implement`).

## 📝 Example Prompt

```md
/clear
```

Claude responds:

```
✅ Context cleared. Ready for new input.
```

> 🧼 Tip: Think of this like restarting a fresh terminal tab with clean history.
