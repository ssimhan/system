# /context — Check Context Window Usage

This command checks how much of Claude's context window is currently filled. It helps avoid hitting the "compacting" threshold, which slows down performance and loses prior history.

## 🧩 What it Does

* Reports how many tokens are currently used in context
* Highlights recent additions or memory overload risks
* Warns if nearing compacting threshold

## 💡 Why It Matters

Claude has no long-term memory. Once the context fills up, it starts compacting — compressing or forgetting prior parts of the conversation.

Using `/context` regularly helps:

* Identify when you need to commit decisions to Markdown
* Decide when to clear context with `/clear`

## 📝 Example Prompt

```md
/context
```

Claude will respond with something like:

```
Context tokens used: 78,292 / 200,000
You are currently safe. Compacting not yet triggered.
```

> ✅ Tip: Use this before large file loads or major implementations to stay in control of Claude’s memory usage.
