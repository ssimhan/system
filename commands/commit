# /commit — Format, Lint, and Commit Code Safely

This command automates best-practice Git commits by analyzing your working directory, staging changes, running lint checks, and committing.

## 🧩 What it Does

* Checks the current branch
* Runs type checks, formatters, and linters
* Generates a commit message
* Stages the appropriate files
* Builds production code (optional)
* Fixes basic errors where possible
* Commits changes atomically

## ✅ Example Flow

```md
/commit
```

Claude responds:

```
✅ Running Pre-Commit Checklist:
- Branch: feat/add-skills-folder
- Staged files: /src/index.js, /skills/refactor.md
- Running lint...pass
- Running formatter...done
- Commit message: "feat: add skills folder with refactor template"
```

## 💡 Best Practices

* Run `/commit` after every complete task
* Add `.lint`, `.prettier`, or `build` scripts in `/scripts/` as needed
* Combine with `/implement` to automate safe shipping

> 🔁 Tip: Use `/clear` after `/commit` to reset context and continue fresh.
