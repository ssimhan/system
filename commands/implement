# /implement — Execute Next Implementation Plan Task

This command reads from `/claude/implementation-plan.md`, determines the current progress, and automatically begins the next task.

## 🧩 What it Does

* Parses `implementation-plan.md`
* Locates the first incomplete task
* Marks it as "in-progress ✅"
* Begins implementing the task
* On success, updates the task to "complete ✅"

## 🪜 Example Plan Snippet

```md
### Phase 1: Project Setup
- [x] Create repo structure
- [x] Initialize `package.json`
- [ ] Scaffold `/docs` and `/claude` folders ✅
- [ ] Add initial commit hooks
```

## 🧠 Best Practices

* Use small, atomic steps in the plan to stay within Claude's context window
* Commit frequently after completing each task

## 📝 Example Prompt

```md
/implement
```

Claude will then:

1. Find the next checkbox task that isn't marked done
2. Start coding
3. Mark the task ✅ and commit the changes
